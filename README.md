# TileMapRendererExperiments
rendering a map of tiles stored in an atlas. Using a geometry shader the vertex data for each tile consists of a single integer.

A servicable atlas class and tile rendering shader that uses a minimal amount of gpu memory and is nice to program with. My plan is to make an infinitely editable tilemap for a massive zelda type game. Editable most likely by an in game editor.
